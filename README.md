#  INPUT AND TRANSFER IMPEDANCE
# Open and Short circuited transmission lines

# 1.INTRODUCTION:

 In electrical and electronic circuits, understanding how signals behave at different points is essential for designing stable and efficient systems. 
 Two important parameters thathelp analyze circuit performance are input impedance and transfer impedance. These
 parameters describe how a circuit interacts with signals applied to it and how effectivelyit transfers those signals to the output.nput and transfer impedance are fundamental
 parameters in electronic circuit analysis. While input impedance focuses on how the circuit interacts with a signal source, transfer impedance explains how that signal is
 translated into an output response. Together, they help engineers design circuits that
 are efficient, stable, and capable of handling signals without loss or distortion.

# 2. Calculating Input Impedance

A signal source with an internal resistance of 200 Ω is connected to the input of an
 amplifier. At the input terminals of the amplifier, the input voltage is measured as 5 V,
 and the input current is 2 mA. Calculate the input impedance (Zi) of the amplifier.

# 3.  Determining Transfer Impedance

 The input current of a circuit is 3 mA, and the output voltage produced due to this
 current is 6 V. Calculate the transfer impedance (Zt).

# Conclusion:

 Input impedance and transfer impedance are two fundamental parameters that play a  crucial role in the analysis, design, and performance of electronic circuits and communication systems. 
 Input impedance determines how a circuit interacts with an  signal source, influencing signal strength, loading effects, and power transfer.
 Transfer impedance, on the other hand, defines how effectively an input signal produces a corresponding output response, making it essential in amplifier analysis, sensor design,
 and transmission line behavior. Understanding these impedances enables engineers to optimize circuit performance for
 maximum efficiency, stability, and signal integrity. Whether in amplifiers, filters, sensors,  or high-frequency communication systems, proper impedance matching and evaluation
 ensure improved functionality, reduced losses, and enhanced overall system reliability.
